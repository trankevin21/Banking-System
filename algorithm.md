Input: The admin user will input the new users and the balances and rates. The user will input how much they want to deposit or withdraw.

Output: The output for admin will be the list of users. THe normal user will see their balances. At the start of the program it will output a menu to select where to go.

Steps: There will be a need for 4 classes. It will be ATM, User, Checking Account, and  Savings Account. The ATM will handle the interface, the user will keep track of all the users, checking account will handle the checking account balances, and the savings will handle the savings account balances and the intrest.
